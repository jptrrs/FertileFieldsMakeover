  <description>v1.1.1
Everybody loves Rainbeau's Fertile Fields... but only for what's inside! I thought it deserved better looks, so that's what I did. This is a recoloring and retexture of its resources. I didn't touch the buildings or the UI, tough, as it seems to me they fit well within the rest of the game. Changes also extend to these other mods, if present: 
- Rainbeau's Concrete
- dninemfive's Fertile Fields Dub's Hygiene Compat
- N7Hunstman Ceramics
